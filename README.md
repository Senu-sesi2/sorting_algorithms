## The readme file for 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O project

#### The following are the general requirements

* 0-Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm

  Prototype: void bubble_sort(int *array, size_t size);
  Youâ€™re expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements (See example below)

* 1-Write a function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm

* 2-Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection sort algorithm

* 3-Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Quick sort algorithm
